Intro

As our project team iteratively develop this website we will need a design-board that guides us as a frame of reference in which our developer will be able to use to deliver the finalized product. The QA Developer and Designer, was able to create a Figma Design mock-up and presented this design to two different people with different perspectives, knowledge of industry, and personal interests. At the bottom of this document will be an image for reference of what was presented to the two distinct people. Below you will see a brief introduction of their character and how their insights might be valuable and the subsequent feedback they provided.

Person 1

Person 1 is a Creative Director at a well known advertisement agency. He has had experience designing websites at the creative level and is sat with tasks to bring new creative ideas to advertisement posts, magazine editions, graphic design or even professional photoshoots. He does not drink coffee and does not particularly identify with the "Caregiver" brand archetype. However, the Figma designer deemed his insight valuable since he has strong creative design principles and can easily identify content placement issues or cohesiveness of content displayed in the design. This is the feedback he gave with the 12/9/23 dated Figma design:
- In the Rewards Section, better align the texts in the what can I earn section. The texts do not follow a grid like pattern that is ubitquous throughtout the website.
- In the Community Section, move Our Active Parternships button from centered align to left align to follow the pattern of the website.
- In the Footer section, utilize the space better that is provided.
    - For instance, make content in line with all other content so it is one concurrent line spanning the whole website.
    - Space out the footer links to the left of the newsletter to take up the same height as the newsletter.
    - Resize the newsletter form to be more compact and re-align the "subscribe" button from right align to left align.
    - Equally space the content in their respective columns, so they maintain the same height as the newsletter form.

Person 2

Person 2 is a Software Developer at a well known CRM company. He has had experience coding websites and developing products in javascript, html, css and other coding softwares. He understands the principles of web-design and implementing functional code. He does drink coffee, however he does not identify with the "Caregiver" brand archetype. However, the Figma designer deemed his insight valuable since he understands the feasibility of the website and is able to easily discern the level of effort needed to code the design. Also, with his familarity coding websites he is able to understand the typical structure of what makes a website, thus giving feedback on items that are missing in the design. This is the feedback he gave with 12/9/23 dated Figma design:
- In the Header section, there is no clear indiction of where the header stops and the content begins. Typically, websites have either a different color or a line to break up these two sections.
    - For this design, we added a line to break up the sections.
- In the Footer section, the newsletter section the button said "Subscribed" and should be "Subscribe" since typically you want the words to be tensed in the action the user should be doing.
- Throughout the website, the design should either justify all text blocks or left align all text blocks since it is mixed throughout the website and should follow one set pattern.
    - For this design, we justified all content.

Overall feedback is - Version B sentiment is higher than Version A. We will finalize our design process and select Version B to begin our coding process with.
