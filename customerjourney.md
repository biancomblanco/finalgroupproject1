Our customer journey will begin with a visible hero section prompting them to buy our bulk coffee items or order online for pickup/delivery. We will have the left side of the hero section have a descriptive title something along the lines of "Care for yourself today - enjoy a cup of coffee" with a short description saying "We have cared for our coffee through its complete lifecycle, selecting and roasting the best coffee beans for your pleasure. Purchase a cup of coffee now and feel the warmth we have imbued into each and every cup." With two buttons underneath this description one to place an item for pickup/delivery and another for bulk purchase of coffeebeans. On the right hand side we could have a slideshow of images passing through one image showcasing the coffeebean growing in the field, another with roasting the coffeebeans, another with a transaction taking place or the coffee being poured and then a picture of our cup or our logo. These images will loop through like a slideshow. I am envisioning that we can have the illusion of a rolling hill where the sunrise is coming up from the east and setting in the west. Where the sunset will be at at our hero section and the sunrise will be at the image slideshow.

We will have a logo banner where the user can go through and see the global/national entities we have partnered with to establish a community everwhere.

We will also have a header bar with a logo where the logo could be a coffee pot with brewed coffee inside but there is a house outline etched in the center, with a navigation bar towards the right.

Below this we will have a mission statement value with strong impactful words and our commitments to bringing a sense of a community online and in-person. In this section we could have links to donate to charities for food banks or education in countries where we source our coffee beans with. We can also allow them to purchase bulk items/place an order on this section, something along the lines of "Place an order with us".

Below this mission statement we will have a testimonial section where we have active members of societies we improved explaining how our impact helped their community. We could also have a personal statement of our CEO giving his testimony on why he is here and the direction he has for the company.

Below this testimonial section we could have a "Join Community" section where we can take personal information and personally subscribe people to our rewards program and here we can showcase something along the lines of "10000+ active members since XXXX date" and "350+ new monthly subscribers". Here we can send them to go subscribe to our loyalty programs.

Below this section we can have a Board section where we place local/website game night events we host with our community. 

At the end we will have a links section that brings them to other pages/links that we provided.

At a very high level we would like them to get hooked on our hero section -> review our header section to get an idea of what we have to offer -> click/search for any sections they would like to go to -> subscribe to our loyalty program -> place an order with us with a simple checkout process.
