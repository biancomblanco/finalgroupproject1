Our Brand Archetype: Caregiver

Our Target Persona: People seeking a sense of community from the ages of 16-36 from all races, religions, regions, orientations, etc that have an affinity towards caffinated beverages or handcrafted drinks.

This target persona will either be an active member of the community, or a person looking to find a cozy low-tempo place to share a cup of coffee with colleagues, friends or family. We will price the products modestly and make a bulk of our proceeds from loyal returning customers. The target persona will interact with our product in the following ways: by simply enjoying the ambiance we provide, the values we stand on, and being able to drink quality coffee. 

This target persona will identify with our brand archetype by our visual acts of community and how we present our physical and digital stores. Both in our physical and digital stores we can host weekly game nights to get people together to play popular or classic games. Our focus is delivering a home away from home experience which our target persona will easily identify.

This target persona will feel compelled to buy our product because of the feeling of giving back to the community and also the warmth and comfort we embody. The target persona will first feel the care we provide for them by delivering exceptional coffee and then they will feel like they are building their home to incorporate more members into the "family". As we build this sense of community they will be more likely to become loyal customers.
